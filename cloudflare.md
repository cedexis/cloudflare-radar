Cedexis collects over a <em>billion</em> web performance metrics a day from websites all over the world. The Cedexis Real User Measurements (RUM) app allows us to collect performance statistics for your website visitors and give you <strong>free</strong> access to this valuable information via the Cedexis portal website.

#### How it Works
By signing up for the Cedexis RUM app via CloudFlare, a small javascript file will be inserted into your website pages.  The javascript file runs quietly in the background collecting a variety of measurement statistics about your website performance.
When you want to see your performance metrics, the CloudFlare marketplace will sign you in to the Cedexis portal website.  Here you will be able to see Page Load Time (PLT) charts and graphs for your website visitors.

#### PLT Charts
By deploying our javascript tag, we are able to collect website performance measurements as seen by your end users anywhere in the world.
The PLT performance measurements we collect are: <em>Http Total Page Load Time, Http Redirect, Http DNS lookup, HTTP Connect, HTTP Send/Receive, HTTP DOM and HTTP Load.  You can also filter data based on country/region, network, URL or browser type.

#### PLT Alerts
PLT Alerts allow you to set up an email alert notification or daily summary when a URL that you are interested in exceeds a specific PLT threshold. For example, you might want to be notified when your home page is taking longer than 3 seconds to load over a given period of time (ie 5 minutes).  With PLT Alerts, you can be proactive about your website performance and also closely monitor SLAs for your cloud service providers.
