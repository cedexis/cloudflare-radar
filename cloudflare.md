Cedexis collects over a <em>billion</em> web performance metrics a day from websites all over the world. The Cedexis Real User Measurements (RUM) app allows us to collect performance statistics for your website visitors and give you <strong>free</strong> access to this valuable information via the Cedexis portal website.

#### How it Works
By signing up for the Cedexis RUM app via CloudFlare, a small javascript file will be deployed to your website pages.  The javascript file runs quietly in the background collecting a variety of measurement statistics about your website performance.
When you want to see your performance metrics, the CloudFlare marketplace will sign you in to the Cedexis portal website.  Here you will be able to see Page Load Time (PLT) charts and graphs for your website visitors.

#### Live Tour
If you would like to see a live sample of how the top Internet providers are performing, check out our [Country Reports](http://www.cedexis.com/reports/#?report=isp&country=US).  This is just a small sample of information available to you as a Cedexis community member.

#### PLT Alerts Subscription Services
When you sign up for our subscription services, you will receive real time (or summary) email alerts when page load times for your website exceed a <em>configurable threshold</em>.  With PLT Alerts, you can be proactive about your website performance and also closely monitor SLAs for your cloud service providers.
